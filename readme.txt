The proposed idea involves user devices offering, during an authentication process, their knowledge of recent interactions with sensors, which the authentication server compares with an identification signature to establish a level of confidence for the user's identity. The outcome of authorization is then used to adaptively update the authentication server's knowledge base, allowing the system to learn the user's habitual behavior

The software requires the neo4j graph library.The academic paper published to present this authentication approach can be requested sending an email to meschial@tcd.ie
